# jQuery Accordion/AJAX Exercise

**Instructions:** Do not modify the HTML and CSS files. Just the `script.js` file.

## Exercise 1 - Accordion

Create an interactive accordion that expands and collapses content sections when the headers are clicked. Only one content section should be open. When a certain header is clicked, only its own content will slide down while the other content sections will collapse/slide up.

## Exercise 2 - AJAX

Clicking on the **Load To-Do Items** button will pull the JSON data from `https://dummyjson.com/todos`. Use `$.ajax()` to fetch the data. After pulling the data and through the *success* method, output each todo as individual `<li>` items to the unordered list.

Example output:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Do something nice for someone you care about</li>
  <li>Memorize a poem</li>
  ...
</ul>
```
